### Solution

Do a dfs and if current node is equal to **p or q or its None** then stop dfs on that path.\
if at a given node we have found both nodes at current node then thats the answer else if we can not find both nodes at all then there is no answer else the answer should be either in the right tree or in the left tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        def find(node):
            if node in (None, p, q):
                return node

            left_find = find(node.left)
            right_find = find(node.right)
            
            if left_find and right_find:
                return node
            elif left_find is None and right_find is None:
                return None
            else:
                return left_find or right_find
        return find(root)
```
