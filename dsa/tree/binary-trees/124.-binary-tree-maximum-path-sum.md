# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum" %}

### Solution

1. To calculate max for root we need max from left and right.
2. To make a V path u can either propagate node value + left or node value + right or node value itself.\
   If you propagate node value + right + left then there will a fork in V which is not what we want.
3. Although node value + right + left is not propagated but this will be considered while computing result.
4. When there is no node what the is maximum sum at that node ? 0 ? no. its -INF.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        result = float("-inf")
        def helper(node):
            nonlocal result
            if node is None:
                return float("-inf")

            left = helper(node.left)
            right = helper(node.right)

            res = max(node.val, node.val + left, node.val + right)
            result = max(result, res, node.val + left + right)
            return res
        
        helper(root)
        
        return result
```
