### Solution

If current node is lower than low remove it with its left subtree because they all will be smaller than this.\
BUT the right tree could have values greater than high.

If current node is higher than high remove it with its right subtree because they all will be higher than this. \
BUT the left tree could have values less than low.

```python
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def trim(node):
            if node is None:
                return
            elif node.val > high:
                return trim(node.left)
            elif node.val < low:
                return trim(node.right)
            else:
                node.left = trim(node.left)
                node.right = trim(node.right)
                return node
        return trim(root)
```
