# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst" %}

### Solution

Do inorder traversal and return kth element from starting.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        stack = []
        while stack or root:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            
            root = stack.pop()
            if k == 1:
                return root.val
            else:
                k -= 1
            
            root = root.right
```

### Follow up Solution

If the tree is modified often.

Every node's index is actually just the count of elements in its left subtree. We can store that then find by rank.
