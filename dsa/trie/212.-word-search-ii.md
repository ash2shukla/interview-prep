### Solution

Do DFS on whole board pruned by the next possible characters.\
eg. For starting the DFS we check which characters are at index0 in words the search can only start from there, To make this "next possible character" lookup faster use trie.

**Implementation Caveat: To not revisit the node where we are coming from while DFS we can set the node value to None and then switch it back to its original value once DFS ends for current node so that other paths can be evaluated. ( L35, L36, L50 )**

```python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}
    
    def add(self, word):
        _iter = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in _iter:
                _iter[char] = {}
            _iter = _iter[char]
        _iter["*"] = word

class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        trie = Trie()
        for word in words:
            trie.add(word)
        
        result = []

        def find(i, j, parent_trie_node):
            if board[i][j] is None:
                return
            
            if not (0<= i <len(board)) or not (0<= j <len(board[0])):
                return
            
            trie_node = parent_trie_node[board[i][j]]

            if "*" in trie_node:
                nonlocal result
                result.append(trie_node["*"])
                trie_node.pop("*") # so that word is not coutned twice
            
            temp_char = board[i][j]
            board[i][j] = None

            if i+1 < len(board) and board[i+1][j] in trie_node:
                find(i+1, j, trie_node)
            
            if i-1 >= 0 and board[i-1][j] in trie_node:
                find(i-1, j, trie_node) 
            
            if j+1 < len(board[0]) and board[i][j+1] in trie_node:
                find(i, j+1, trie_node)
            
            if j-1 >= 0 and board[i][j-1] in trie_node:
                find(i, j-1, trie_node) 
            
            board[i][j] = temp_char
        
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[i])):
                if board[i][j] in trie.root:
                    find(i, j, trie.root)
        
        return result
