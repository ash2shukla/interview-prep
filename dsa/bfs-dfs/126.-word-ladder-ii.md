### Solution

Do a Level order traversal on this graph. Mind that while doing level order traversal levels will be represented using a dict as every element can have multiple different parents.

```python
class Solution:
    def findLadders(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        wordList = set(wordList)
        wordList.add(beginWord)

        def get_neighbors(word):
            for i in range(len(word)):
                for char in string.ascii_lowercase:
                    expected_word = word[:i] + char + word[i+1:]
                    if expected_word in wordList:
                        yield expected_word
        
        
        current = {beginWord: [[beginWord]]}
        visited = {beginWord}
        while current:
            next = defaultdict(list)
            for node, paths in current.items():
                if node == endWord:
                    return paths
                for nbr in get_neighbors(node):
                    if nbr not in visited:
                        next[nbr].extend([path + [nbr] for path in paths])
            visited.update(next)
            current = next
        return []
```
