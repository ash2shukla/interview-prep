### Solution

Smallest distance between two nodes is required so do BFS.\
To get the neighbour nodes we just need words that are off by 1 character,\
The logic to get these can be word\[:i] + "a/b/c/d/e/f/..." + word\[i+1:] exists in wordList then it can be added else not. it will be O(26\*N) but if we check whether all words are off by 1 then that will be O(N\*N)

```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        wordList = set(wordList)
        wordList.add(beginWord)

        def get_neighbors(word):
            res = set()
            for i in range(len(word)):
                for j in string.ascii_lowercase:
                    expected_word = word[:i] + j + word[i+1:]
                    if expected_word in wordList:
                        res.add(expected_word)
            return res
 
        q = deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        
        visited = set()
        # {beginWord}

        while q:
            node, dist = q.popleft()
            
            for nbr in get_neighbors(node):
                if nbr == endWord:
                    return dist + 1

                if nbr not in visited:
                    q.append((nbr, dist+1))
                    visited.add(nbr)
        return 0

        
```
