### **Solution**

Keep track of indexes of elements. Pop all of the elements in stack which are smaller than current element. If we follow this for all elements then current element will be the nearest greater element to all the popped elements. so set the result as i - index of popped element for popped element.

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * len(temperatures)
        mono_queue = []

        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while mono_queue and (mono_queue[-1][0] < t) :
                _, index = mono_queue.pop()
                result[index] = i - index
            else:
                mono_queue.append((t, i))
        return result
```
