### Solution

&#x20;__ ---- | ----\
\[1, 2, 3, 4]  the median is highest of first half + lowest of second half if elements are even.\
\----- | ---\
\[1, 2,    3] the median is highest of first half if the elements are odd.\
\
Keep a max heap for first half and min heap for second half. If the element count is even we need to insert the extra element in max heap only.\
\
After we are done with insertion we need to check if the max of max heap is less than min of min heap or not, if its not then we will swap both of them.

```python
class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        self.min_heap = []
        self.max_heap = []
        
    @property
    def element_count(self):
        return len(self.max_heap) + len(self.min_heap)
    
    def _rebalance(self):
        if self.max_heap and self.min_heap:
            if -self.max_heap[0] > self.min_heap[0]:
                max_heap_el = heappop(self.max_heap)
                min_heap_el = heappop(self.min_heap)
                
                heappush(self.max_heap, -min_heap_el)
                heappush(self.min_heap, -max_heap_el)

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        if self.element_count % 2 == 0:
            # python only implements minheap so to convert it into max heap we just insert -num
            heappush(self.max_heap, -num)
        else:
            heappush(self.min_heap, +num)
        
        self._rebalance()

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if self.element_count % 2 == 0:
            return (self.min_heap[0] - self.max_heap[0]) / 2
        else:
            return -self.max_heap[0]
```
