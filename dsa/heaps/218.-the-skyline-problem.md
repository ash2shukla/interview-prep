### Solution

The points can either be start of building or ending of building. Whenever a new building starts or ends we can add it to result with x-ordinate and max y-ordinate at that x-ordinate. To keep track of max height at a given point we can use a max heap ( or min heap with minus ).

```python
class Solution:
    def getSkyline(self, buildings: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        heap = [0] # initially max height is 0
        
        coords = []
        
        for l, r, h in buildings:
            coords.append((l, -h)) # -h represents start of building
            coords.append((r, +h)) # +h represents end of building
        
        coords.sort() # sort by x coord followed by y coord (height)
        result = []

        for coord, h in coords:
            prev_max = heap[0]
            if h > 0: # if a building ends at this point 
                heap.remove(-h) # we should remove it from heap
                heapify(heap)
            else:
                heappush(heap, h)

            if prev_max != heap[0]: # if max has changed in heap
                result.append((coord, -heap[0])) # we should add this to result

        return result
```
