### Solution

The maximum water that can be collected at an index i is the height of the pole at that index and the maximum boundaries on both of its sides.\
So first calculate max heights in reversed direction then just do h - min(bkwd max h, fwd max h)

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        backwards_max = [0] * len(height)
        
        for i in reversed(range(len(height)-1)):
            backwards_max[i] = max(backwards_max[i+1], height[i+1])

        result = 0
        fwd = 0

        for i, h in enumerate(height):
            bkwd = backwards_max[i]
            result += max(min(fwd, bkwd) - h, 0)
            fwd = max(h, fwd)

        return result
```
