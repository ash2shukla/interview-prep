# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

### Solution

Fast slow pointer does the job. Start both pointers towards end. When one reaches end and other doesn't that means the other pointer is at the "offset node" (offset node being the difference between length of ll1 and ll2 from intersection) we can now reiterate from the other linked lists's head till both of them coincide at their intersection.

```python
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        headA_temp = headA
        headB_temp = headB

        while headA and headB:
            if headA is headB:
                return headA

            headA = headA.next
            headB = headB.next
        

        if headA is None:
            eq_headB = headB_temp
            while headB:
                eq_headB = eq_headB.next
                headB = headB.next

            headB = eq_headB
            headA = headA_temp

        if headB is None:
            eq_headA = headA_temp
            while headA:
                eq_headA = eq_headA.next
                headA = headA.next
            headA = eq_headA
            headB = headB_temp
        
        while headA and headB:
            if headA is headB:
                return headA

            headA = headA.next
            headB = headB.next

```

An alternate of writing above logic more succinctly.

```python
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        headA_temp = headA
        headB_temp = headB
        while headA is not headB:
            headA = headB_temp if headA is None else headA.next
            headB = headA_temp if headB is None else headB.next
        return headA
```
