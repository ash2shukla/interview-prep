### Solution

Try to reuse the reverse function.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, head, k):
        prev = None
        for i in range(k):
            if head is None:
                return self.reverse(prev, i)
            temp = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = temp
        return prev, head

    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        result = prev = ListNode(None)
        while head:
            temp_head = head
            next_start, next_head = self.reverse(head, k)  
            prev.next = next_start
            prev = head
            head = next_head
        return result.next
```
