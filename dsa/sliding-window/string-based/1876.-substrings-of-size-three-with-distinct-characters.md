### Solution

We will shrink window if there is any character existing already in current window.\
\
To improve lookup of whether character already exists we can use a hashset.\
\
If the current window has characters more than or equal to expected SIZE ( here 3 ) we can increment count of result by 1.\
\


```python
class Solution:
    SIZE = 3
    def countGoodSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        curr_window = set()
        start = 0
        result = 0
        for end, char in enumerate(s):
            while char in curr_window:
                if s[start] in curr_window:
                    curr_window.remove(s[start])
                start += 1

            curr_window.add(char)
            
            if len(curr_window) >= self.SIZE:
                result += 1
        return result
                
```
