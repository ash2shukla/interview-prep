### **Solution**

Optimized solution is not possible ( it could be done if the words could overlap ). Simply check if the word formed at current index is a "word anagram" of the dictionary.\
\
( small optimizations are possible while creating the counter or in is\_anagram function )

```python
class Solution:
    def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        word_len = len(words[0])
        substr_len = word_len * len(words)
        words = Counter(words)
        
        def is_anagram(counter):
            if len(counter) == len(words) and all(counter[c] == words[c] for c in words):
                return True
            return False
        
        result = []

        for i in range(len(s)):
            counter = Counter([s[j:j+word_len] for j in range(i, i+substr_len, word_len)])
            if is_anagram(counter):
                result.append(i)

        return result
```
