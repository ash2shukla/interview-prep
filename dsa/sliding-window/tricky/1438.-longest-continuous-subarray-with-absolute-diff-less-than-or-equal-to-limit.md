# 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-l" %}

### Solution

Record min and max in monoqueues if the difference is greater than limit skew the window from start. ( keep removing elements from deque head if they are out of the window )

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        max_q = deque()
        min_q = deque()
        
        start = 0
        result = 0
        
        for end, num in enumerate(nums):
            while max_q and max_q[-1][-1] < num:
                max_q.pop()
            while min_q and min_q[-1][-1] > num:
                min_q.pop()
            max_q.append((end, num))
            min_q.append((end, num))

            while max_q and min_q and max_q[0][-1] - min_q[0][-1] > limit:
                if max_q[0][0] == start:
                    max_q.popleft()
                if min_q[0][0] == start:
                    min_q.popleft()
                start += 1
            
            result = max(result, end - start + 1)
        return result

```
