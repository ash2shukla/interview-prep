### Solution

If we didn't have negative numbers we could just expand and squeeze with sliding window like [Q209.](../minimize-maximize-window/209.-minimum-size-subarray-sum.md) \
The problem with negative numbers is that we cant be sure if reducing window will increase or decrease the sum.\
To solve this we can keep track of increasing cum sum in a mono queue ( remember while maintaining the mono queue to look for popped element whether its greater than k or not if it is then we can just mark the answer as the popped\_index + 1 )\
Now we can also squeeze the window if from left side of queue the difference is greater than or equal to k.

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        window = deque()
        cum_sum = 0
        start = 0
        result = float("+inf")
        for end, num in enumerate(nums):
            cum_sum += num
            if cum_sum >= k:
                result = min(result, end + 1)

            while window and cum_sum - window[0][1] >= k:
                popped_idx, popped_sum = window.popleft()
                result = min(result, end - popped_idx)
            
            # if last is greater than current cum_sum 
            # we can remove it
            # because having smaller number on index greater than previous
            # will always give bigger sum and shorter subarray.
            while window and window[-1][1] >= cum_sum:
                window.pop()

            window.append((end, cum_sum))
        return -1 if result == float("+inf") else result
```
