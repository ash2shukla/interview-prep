### Solution

Whenever we encounter a substring that is valid, not only this substring but all of the remaining strings that contain this strings will be valid. So if we come across a valid substring instead of doing result += 1 we do result += len(s) - i which means we will add all substrings ahead and before of this index to result too (because the string only contains a, b and c)

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        is_valid = lambda x: all(x[char] > 0 for char in "abc")
        window = Counter()
        result = 0
        start = 0
        for end, char in enumerate(s):
            window[char] += 1
            
            while is_valid(window):
                result += len(s) - end
                window[s[start]] = max(window[s[start]]-1, 0)
                start += 1
        return result
```
