### Solution

We can find the largest substring that contains only ones while allowing only one zero. But instead of setting the answer as the number of characters in that substring it would be the number of characters in that substring - 1 as we are deleting that element instead of flipping it to 1.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start = 0
        result = 0
        window_zeroes = 0
        k = 1
        for end, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num == 0:
                window_zeroes += 1
            
            # shrink the window
            while window_zeroes > k:
                if nums[start] == 0:
                    window_zeroes -= 1
                start += 1

            result = max(result, end - start + 1)
        return result - 1
```
